		<h2>Course Contract</h2>
	<p>I, Morris J Colato, agree to abide by the terms in my Fall Web 115 Course with my instructor, DI Von Briesen.</p>
	<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world.</p>
	<p>I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
	<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.</p>  
	<p>As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
	<p>Signed: Morris Colato 8/22/2022</p>
